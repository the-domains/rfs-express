Rfs express is a hotshot service company that was founded in September of 2006 and is currently partnered with United Vision Logistics, located in Lafayette, LA.   Since our founding, I have traveled just under one million miles and have made over 2500 deliveries with no accidents or violations.

We service primarily the Oil & Gas Industry, but we are available for whatever you need.  I currently use a GMC Sierra pickup and am very comfortable delivering cargo up to 1800 pounds and 8 to 10 feet in length depending on weight.  Hazardous loads not requiring placards are no problem.
